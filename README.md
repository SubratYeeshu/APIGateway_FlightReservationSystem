FRONTEND - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND

- We need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices 
- Using this middle end, when client sends request we will be able to make decision that which microservice will respond to this request
- We can do message validation, response transformation, rate limiting
- We try to prepare an API gatewawy that acts as the middle end
- API Gateway acts as a "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, any web application, or real-time communication applications.
