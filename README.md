FRONTEND - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND

- We need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices 
- Using this middle end, when client sends request we will be able to make decision that which microservice will respond to this request
- We can do message validation, response transformation, rate limiting
- We try to prepare an API gatewawy that acts as the middle end
